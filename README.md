# Howto
## Download
To download the library you need to use cURL or Git with the commands in terminal:
###### Git
To download repository with Git you need to open the terminal with supporting [git](https://git-scm.com/) and then run a command
```
git clone https://github.com/1mpossible-code/yop-gallery.git
```
Then you will have the versions in a such folders _(P.S. the last version is 0.1)_

Copy the script to your script folder:
```
cp yop-gallery/0.1/yop-gallery.min.js /your/path/
```
###### cURL
To download the minimal version of YOP-gallery use cURL by running command in terminal:
Open your project script's folder:
```
cd /your/path/
```
and download YOP-gallery:
```
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/1mpossible-code/yop-gallery/master/0.1/yop-gallery.min.js
```
## Installation
Link it in the **footer** _**NOT IN THE HEADER**_ of your HTML file
```html
<script src="/your/path/yop-gallery.min.js"></script>
```
Then you need to create elements:
* With class `yop_gal` (elements that will be paginated)
* With id `yop-paginator` (If you need a button "show more")
* With id `yop-navigation-paginator` (It's a paginator)

You can put the elements into other tags and give them few more classes, it will not break the program

**_You can see the example of using YOP-gallery in a folder `exapmle`_**

# Documentation
_GitBook documentation coming soon_

To edit preferences you have 3 options which situated on the start of the file `yop-gallery.min.js`:
```
let maxPhotosImages=3,whatVisible=1,currentPage=1;
```
* `maxPhotosImages` is the number of max content blocks with class `yop_gal` on a one page
* `whatVisible` is the number of page that is visible right now
* `currentPage` is the number of active page 

_P.S. If you use different `whatVisible` and `currentPage` it can break the script!_
